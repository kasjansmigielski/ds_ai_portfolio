In 2019 I graduated from mechatronics at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, which gave me the desire to explore new technologies. I have been working as an engineer in the manufacturing industry for 5 years, where data is the most important part of my job. By analyzing production and quality data, I am able to optimize processes and find innovative solutions to increase productivity and efficiency.

For several months now, I have been intrigued by the topic of AI - so much so that I completed a Data Scientist course and started expanding my portfolio. **I am currently in the process of finding a job in this field** so that I can combine my great passion with my professional life.

## I invite you to check out my portfolio from the world of data and AI!

I encourage you to visit here regularly, because I have a lot of ideas for expanding my portfolio.
