## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am an <strong>AI Engineer and Data Scientist</strong> specializing in designing <strong>intelligent data-driven systems</strong> — from data analysis and EDA, through Machine Learning and Computer Vision models, to <strong>production-grade LLM architectures and RAG systems</strong>.

I combine <strong>engineering experience from industry</strong> with modern AI technologies, building solutions that:

- solve real business and research problems,
- are scalable and production-ready,
- connect AI with solid software engineering.

## My Professional Journey

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In 2019, I graduated with a degree in <strong>Mechatronics</strong> from Wrocław University of Science and Technology. Over the following years, I worked as an engineer in the manufacturing industry, where quality and process data played a crucial role in optimizing processes and decision-making.

Working with real industrial data:

- sparked my interest in data analysis,
- taught me systems thinking,
- showed me the importance of data quality and business context.

The natural step was to transition towards <strong>Data Science and AI</strong>.

## Current Focus

I completed the <strong>Data Scientist</strong> track and started systematically building a portfolio of projects covering:

- exploratory data analysis (EDA),
- analytical applications in Streamlit,
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning systems,
- solutions based on LLMs and semantic search.

I currently work on projects in:

- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
- **Computer Vision**
- **LLM integration and RAG**
- **AI in production environments**

I hold the <strong>AWS Machine Learning Engineer – Associate</strong> certification, confirming my competencies in designing and deploying ML solutions in the cloud.

## 🎓 Teaching & Mentoring

Since **January 2025**, I have been a **Student Success Manager at Gotoit**, where I mentor a Data Science course. I conduct weekly live sessions where we expand knowledge in data and AI.

Additionally, I teach and conduct workshops for:

- **Data Science course participants** — Python, SQL, EDA, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- **High school students** (IT profile) — practical AI applications
- **Teachers and pedagogical staff** — responsible and practical use of AI

My teaching philosophy focuses on **understanding, not memorization**, **real cases** instead of artificial datasets, and **critical thinking about AI** rather than hype.

I have also created dedicated resources for my students:

- **[ML Cheatsheet](https://kasjansmigielski.github.io/ml-cheatsheets/)** — comprehensive Machine Learning reference guide
- **[Coding Cheatsheet](https://kasjansmigielski.github.io/coding-cheatsheets/)** — Python and SQL exercises for practice

## 📚 Academic Activity

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In March 2025, I started <strong>master's studies in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>.

My master's thesis focuses on:

- applying computer vision,
- analyzing object behaviors in video material,
- using ML and DL algorithms in biomedical research.

The project is carried out in collaboration with the <strong>Medical University of Wrocław</strong>.

## About This Portfolio

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Here you will find many projects I have been working on recently: from domain exploration (EDA) on ready-made datasets, through creating Streamlit applications allowing you to browse data in a simple way, and ending with AI-powered and Machine Learning-based applications to find patterns invisible at first glance.

<strong>I encourage you to visit here regularly — I intend to expand my portfolio with new ideas on an ongoing basis.</strong>
