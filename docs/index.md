# Projects from the world of data, Python programming and AI technologies

## Welcome to my website dedicated to projects in the field of data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

**My short story:**<br>
In 2019, I graduated with a degree in Mechatronics from Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, sparking my desire to explore new technologies. Over the past five years, I worked as an engineer in the manufacturing industry, where data played a crucial role in my work. By analyzing production and quality data, I was able to optimize processes and find innovative solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency.

In recent months, I have developed a strong interest in AI, which led me to **complete a Data Scientist course and start building my portfolio**. I have developed several practical projects and have more ideas that I aim to turn into commercial products.

I have also **secured my dream job in a Data Science department**, where I will be working on projects involving:
* Computer Vision
* Machine Learning
* NLP
* Generative AI

This site will document my scientific and technical progress, as **I will also begin my master's studies in AI and Machine Learning in March**.

**Brief info about the portfolio:**<br>

Here you will find many projects I have been working on recently: from domain exploration (EDA) on ready-made datasets, through creating Streamlit applications - allowing you to browse data in a simple way, and ending with AI-powered and Machine Learning-based applications - to find patterns invisible at first glance.

I invite you to familiarize yourself with the projects and I hope that everyone will find something for themselves. **I encourage you to visit here regularly - I intend to expand my portfolio with new ideas on an ongoing basis.**
