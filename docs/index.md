# Projects from the world of data, Python programming and AI technologies

## Introduction
Welcome to my website dedicated to projects in the field of data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

## My short story
<!-- <div style="text-align: justify;"> -->
In 2019, I graduated with a degree in Mechatronics from Wrocław University of Science and Technology, sparking my desire to explore new technologies. Over the past five years, I worked as an engineer in the manufacturing industry, where data played a crucial role in my work. By analyzing production and quality data, I was able to optimize processes and find innovative solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency.<br>

<!-- </div style> -->

In recent months, I have developed a strong interest in AI, which led me to **complete a Data Scientist course and start building my portfolio**. I have developed several practical projects and have more ideas that I aim to turn into commercial products.




I have also **secured my dream job in a Data Science department**, where I will be working on projects involving:

- Computer Vision,<br>
- Machine Learning,<br>
- NLP,<br>
- Generative AI.

## My current activity
Due to my growing passion for AI and Data Science, **I began my master's studies in March 2025 in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.** I am deeply committed to advancing my academic career. My master's thesis will focus on utilizing computer vision algorithms in a project collaborating with the Medical University of Wrocław. **This project will involve detecting larvae and analyzing their behaviors under experimental conditions.**

Additionally, since January 2025, **I have been a Student Success Manager at Gotoit, where I have the opportunity to mentor a Data Science course.** I conduct weekly live sessions where we expand our knowledge in data and AI. I am also experimenting with creating tutorials on Python, SQL, and other libraries useful in the Data Science field.

I am also preparing for the **AWS ML Associate exam**, which will allow me to expand my knowledge of cloud services and become a specialist in the Machine Learning field.

## About portfolio
Here you will find many projects I have been working on recently: from domain exploration (EDA) on ready-made datasets, through creating Streamlit applications - allowing you to browse data in a simple way, and ending with AI-powered and Machine Learning-based applications - to find patterns invisible at first glance.

I invite you to familiarize yourself with the projects and I hope that everyone will find something for themselves. **I encourage you to visit here regularly - I intend to expand my portfolio with new ideas on an ongoing basis.**
