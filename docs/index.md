# Projects from the world of data, Python programming and AI technologies

## Welcome to my website dedicated to projects in the field of data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

**My short story:**<br>
In 2019 I graduated from mechatronics at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, which gave me the desire to explore new technologies. I have been working as an engineer in the manufacturing industry for 5 years, where data is the most important part of my job. By analyzing production and quality data, I am able to optimize processes and find innovative solutions to increase productivity and efficiency.

For several months now, I have been intrigued by the topic of AI - so much so that I completed a Data Scientist course and started expanding my portfolio. **I am currently in the process of finding a job in this field so that I can combine my great passion with my professional life.**

**Brief info about the portfolio:**<br>

Here you will find many projects I have been working on recently: from domain exploration (EDA) on ready-made datasets, through creating Streamlit applications - allowing you to browse data in a simple way, and ending with AI-powered and Machine Learning-based applications - to find patterns invisible at first glance.

I invite you to familiarize yourself with the projects and I hope that everyone will find something for themselves. **I encourage you to visit here regularly - I intend to expand my portfolio with new ideas on an ongoing basis.**
