*Project: June 2025 — November 2025*

**Role:** Product Owner

**Status:** Completed

## Project description

The job search process in the IT industry is for candidates:

- time-consuming,
- chaotic,
- based on manually matching CVs to dozens of offers.

Candidates often:

- don't know which offers are actually suited to their profile,
- send the same CV to different companies,
- waste time on document revisions without feedback.

The market lacked a tool that **simultaneously analyzes CVs and job requirements** and indicates the best matches automatically.

---

## Solution

**Career Guide** is an intelligent platform using AI algorithms that shortens the path from CV to a matched job offer.

The system:

- analyzes the user's CV content,
- compares it with hundreds of job offers,
- calculates percentage match of profile to listings,
- enables generating CV tailored to a specific offer,
- supports the user through an AI assistant.

The product was designed as a **scalable tool** for a broad group of IT candidates.
