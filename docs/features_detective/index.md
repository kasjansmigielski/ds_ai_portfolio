# Features Detective App

*Date of creation: 2024-10-30*

**Project description:**<br>
The aim of the project was to create a universal application that allows for detecting the most important features in a given data set. In short - the user uploads data or loads a ready data set in the appropriate format, then selects automatic detection of the column they want to analyze or makes this selection themselves. Finally, they receive a generated graph of the significance of features that have the greatest impact on the previously selected column. The user also receives a clear description of the graph along with recommendations - what can be improved to, for example, improve the analyzed data.<br>

**Main functionalities:**<br>
- the user can load a CSV/JSON file with data or use a ready-made sample dataset,<br>
- the user indicates the target column -> additionally, they can use automatic column detection (generated by LLM),<br>
- the application automatically recognizes whether the loaded data is related to the regression or classification problem and selects the appropriate AI model training algorithm on this basis,<br>
- based on the trained model, a chart containing the most important features is displayed,<br>
- finally, the user receives a clear description of the chart along with recommendations - what actions to implement to improve the results related to the analyzed target data column.

**To train the AI ​​model** I used PyCaret tools and I have included the implementation in a notebook ready for download:<br>
