# Audio Notes App

*Date of creation: 2024-10-03*

**Project description:**<br>
The goal of the project was to create the first AI-powered application. To do this, I used two LLM models from OpenAI: `whisper-1` (speech -> text) and `text-embeddings-3-large` (text -> embeddings). <br>

**Main functionalities:**<br>
- recording and listening to voice notes,<br>
- transcription of voices into text using AI,<br>
- ability to collect notes in the QDrant database,<br>
- semantic data search, using the text processing algorithm on embeddings and finding similarities based on Cosinus Similarity.<br>

**Skills:**<br>
- Python,<br>
- QDrant,<br>
- OpenAI embeddings,<br>
- OpenAI whisper-1,<br>
- Streamlit,<br>
- Dotenv,<br>
- PyDub,<br>
- io,<br>
- md5.

The application has been deployed on the Streamlit Community App **helps me generate notes more easily and most importantly enables contextual search using AI.**
