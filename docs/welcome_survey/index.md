# Welcome Survey App

*2024-09-22*

**Project description:**<br>
The aim of the project was to create an application that would allow for simple filtering and browsing of data from a sample welcome survey (the data was appropriately anonymized).<br> The aim of the application was to consolidate components from the Streamlit library and familiarize users with the proper management of the application state (`st.session_state`) so that all buttons and interactions were responsive to each other.

**Main functionalities:**<br>
- the ability to browse an anonymous survey to familiarize yourself with the Streamlit interface,<br>
- various types of filters allow you to get to know the analyzed data in more detail,<br>
- visualizations are also included
the application also contains interesting visualizations and for the most persistent - curiosities await!

**Skills:**<br>
- Python,<br>
- Pandas,<br>
- Matplotlib,<br>
- Seaborn,<br>
- Streamlit,<br>
- Boto3.
