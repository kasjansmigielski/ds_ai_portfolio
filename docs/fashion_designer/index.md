# Fashion Designer

*Project start date*: 2024-11-07*

*Estimated date of completion: 2024-11-18*

**Project description:**<br>
I am currently working on a project that is supposed to imitate the functionality of a fashion designer. The idea for the project came to me because of the needs of my life partner, who designs women's underwear. This application is supposed to automate the design process and will additionally be an inspiration for creating new elements from the world of fashion.<br>

**Main functionalities:**<br>
- the user selects the type of service they want to design,<br>
- the user defines the project concept - then receives visual inspirations generated by AI,<br>
- the user shares data (the application guides the user step by step - visualization of individual stages),<br>
- the user has the right to use construction allowance or service with the prediction of the regression model (calculating the most optimal required amount of material),<br>
- the application - defined, calculates and saves parameters with a particular additional element,<br>
- the AI ​​model draws the project based on the parameters calculated as a result,<br>
- the user has the right to make corrections to the parameters * After approving the project - the user has the option to download the project in PDF format,<br>
- finally, the AI ​​model is a summary of the project in the form of a short description and sending recommendations for use with plugins included in the program.

**Stay tuned** - I will be sharing progress in creating a new project!
