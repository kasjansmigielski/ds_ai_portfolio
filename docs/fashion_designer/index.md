# Fashion Designer

*Project start date: 2024-11-07*

*Estimated date of completion: 2024-11-18*

**Project description:**<br>
I am currently working on a project that is supposed to imitate the functionality of a fashion designer. The idea for the project came to me because of the needs of my life partner, who designs women's underwear. This application is supposed to automate the design process and will additionally be an inspiration for creating new elements from the world of fashion.<br>

**Main functionalities:**<br>
- the user selects what type of underwear they want to design,<br>
- the user specifies the initial design concept - then receives visual inspiration generated by AI,<br>
- the user provides the appropriate dimensions (the application guides the user step by step - visualizing individual stages),<br>
- the application - using appropriate formulas, calculates and saves parameters related to the individual type of underwear,<br>
- then the AI ​​model draws the underwear design based on the parameters calculated in the previous step,<br>
- the user has the right to make corrections to the parameters,<br>
- after approving the design - the user can download the design in PDF format,<br>
- finally, the AI ​​model generates a summary of the project in the form of a short description and recommendations related to the creation process.

**Stay tuned:**<br>
I will be sharing progress in creating a new project!
