# Fashion Designer

*Date of creation: 2024-12-15*

## Project description
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The aim of this project was to create an imitation of a fashion designer. The idea for the project came to me because of the needs of my life partner, who designs women's underwear. This application is to automate the design process and will additionally be an inspiration to create new elements from the world of fashion.
