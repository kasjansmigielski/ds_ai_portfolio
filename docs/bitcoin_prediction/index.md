# Bitcoin Price Prediction

*Project start: 2025-02-04*

## Project description
<div style="text-align: justify">
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for Bitcoin price movements using <strong>deep learning techniques</strong>. The approach integrates comprehensive <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> with advanced time series forecasting methods, specifically <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks</strong>. By leveraging historical Bitcoin pricing data (from Kaggle), technical indicators, and market sentiment metrics, the model aims to forecast future price trends with meaningful accuracy. The implementation utilizes <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>Keras</strong> frameworks to build, train, and evaluate the LSTM architecture, which is particularly suited for capturing temporal dependencies in financial time series data. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning to cryptocurrency market analysis and provides insights into the factors influencing Bitcoin price volatility.
